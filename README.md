## Running the project

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## Working with the old Everybody Edits databases

1. Get the ArchivEE dump from LukeM's host: https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ahk6r7GFlmqRkK4XpcTX7oHrY0QxbQ?e=6XQ6MP
2. Get the Smileys dump from...  welp, TODO - need to find a good place to host this somewhat big dataset
